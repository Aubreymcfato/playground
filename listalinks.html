Wikipedia is one of the most popular sources of all health information, including for drugs, treatments, medical conditions, and whatever else people use to make health decisions. For anyone trying to share health information Wikipedia is the fastest and cheapest way to share information with people who are trying to learn more. If you post information to Wikipedia then you can also get an audience traffic report which almost always shows more traffic than other available communication channels like posting to one’s own website or social media.
